# Enhanced Input System in Unreal Engine – Course ProjectThis repository contains the project files and code developed during the **Enhanced Input System** course for Unreal Engine 5. It demonstrates modern input handling techniques using the new Enhanced Input plugin introduced in UE5.## 🎯 Project Goals- Learn the basics and advanced features of the Enhanced Input System- Replace legacy input bindings with the Enhanced Input framework- Implement context-based input actions and mappings- Support multiple input devices (keyboard, gamepad, mouse)- Enable modular and scalable input setups for characters and UI## 🛠️ Features Implemented- ✅ Input Action & Mapping Context assets- ✅ Character movement using input bindings- ✅ Input-triggered abilities (e.g., jump, sprint, crouch)- ✅ Support for gamepad and keyboard controls- ✅ Input layer prioritization (UI vs gameplay)- ✅ Swappable input contexts at runtime## 📁 Project Structure    ProjectRoot/    ├── Config/    ├── Content/    │   ├── Input/    │   │   ├── InputActions/    │   │   └── InputMappingContexts/    │   └── Characters/    │       └── PlayerCharacter/    ├── Source/    │   └── YourProjectName/    │       ├── Player/    │       └── Input/    └── README.md## 📚 References- [Unreal Engine Documentation – Enhanced Input](https://docs.unrealengine.com/5.0/en-US/enhanced-input-overview/)- Course material from [Course Platform or Instructor Name]## 📄 LicenseThis project is licensed for educational purposes.
